# Lung Cancer Detection
 
This project implements machine learning algorithms to detect lung cancer using patient data. It explores models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest to classify the presence of lung cancer, aiming to provide a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool.<br>

Features<br>
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for modeling.<br>
Model Training: Implements SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.<br>
Model Evaluation: Compares models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.<br>
Visualization: Provides visual insights into model performance.<br>
Results<br>
The models are evaluated on various metrics to determine the best-performing algorithm for lung cancer detection. Results are visualized for better interpretability.
